R code used for my Individual Research Project (IRP), Project name: Using AI driven approaches to identify early-stage diagnostic biomarkers for Head and Neck Cancers in ethnically diverse populations.

This project aims to leverage our group's interest in machine learning to unlock insights from early-stage
SCCHC multi-omic data across diverse ethnicities. This will be achieved by:

1.Applying established machine learning models: You will adapt and apply our group's existing machine
learning models to analyse early-stage SCCHC multi-omic datasets obtained from various ethnic
populations. This will involve utilizing a comprehensive suite of R and Python-based software for integrated
data analysis.

2.Developing multi-dimensional transcriptional models: By integrating AI models, we aim to construct
robust transcriptional models to identify potential early-stage diagnostic biomarkers for SCCHN, specifically
tailored to different ethnic populations.
